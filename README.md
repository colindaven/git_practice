# git_practice

Colin Davenport, April 2021


Requires:
 - user account on on github
 - git software on your local machine 
 - Alternative 1: if not possible, you can fork the repository and make changes via using edit in the web browser
 - Alternative 2: use github codespaces if available on your user account

```
# 1. Simple - if you have write access to the repository

# clone (your machine)
git clone https://github.com/colindaven/git_practice/

# edit a file locally
nano README.md
<write something, save it>

# check the changes that were made
git diff

# add the file locally
git add *

# commit the changes locally
git commit -m "changed README.md"

# push the changes
git push


# 2. More complex, but more typical. Fork the repo first to your account, then do as above

# fork the repo to your account

Follow section #1 - now you have write access!

To add to the original repository, you need to create a pull request. Try it!


# 3 Demo commands

git status
git log
git mv
git rm
git branch -a 

A .gitignore file
```
