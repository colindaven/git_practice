# git_practice

Colin Davenport, April - October 2021


Requires:
 - user account on github
 - git software on your local machine 
 - Alternative 1: if not possible, you can fork the repository and make changes via using edit in the web browser
 - Alternative 2: use github codespaces if available on your user account (try pressing the full stop key "." on your keyboard while on this webpage). You can then probably suggest changes in the form of so-called patches as commits and pull requests to my repository.

```
# 1. Simple - if you have write access to the repository

# clone (your machine)
git clone https://github.com/colindaven/git_practice/

# edit a file locally
nano README.md
<write something, save it>

# check the changes that were made
git diff

# add the file locally
git add *

# commit the changes locally
git commit -m "changed README.md"

# push the changes
git push


# 2. More complex, but more typical. Fork the repo first to your account, then do as above

# fork the repo to your account (via a button at the top right!)

Follow section #1 - now you have write access to your own forked copy of the repository.

To add to the original repository, you need to create a pull request. Try it! The maintainer of the main repository can then accept, discuss, or reject your changes as they see fit.


# 3 Demo commands

git status
git log
git mv
git rm
git branch -a 

A .gitignore file
```







```
